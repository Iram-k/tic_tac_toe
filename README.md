# Tic-Tac-Toe: Human vs. Computer

## Project Overview

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C++. It allows a human player to compete against a computer that uses the Minimax algorithm with backtracking to make optimal decisions. The player can select their moves by entering a number between 1 and 9, corresponding to the grid position.

The game will alternate turns between the player and the computer until a winner is declared or the board is full (resulting in a tie). The game board updates after each move, and the winner is displayed when the game ends.

## Features

- **Human vs. Computer:** The player plays against an AI opponent.
- **Minimax Algorithm:** The computer uses the Minimax algorithm to determine the best move.
- **Dynamic Board Display:** The board is updated and displayed after each turn.
- **Input System:** The player selects moves by entering a number between 1-9 corresponding to board positions.

## How the Game Works

The board layout is a 3x3 grid, with positions numbered as follows:
